00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
Hi there! I've shown you previously

1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,965
how to build this HTML page.

2
00:00:03,965 --> 00:00:07,218
That page like this one is not very inspiring,

3
00:00:07,218 --> 00:00:08,505
so what I'd like to do now,

4
00:00:08,505 --> 00:00:10,230
is dive deeper and show you how to

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,153
create a richer page like this one.

6
00:00:14,153 --> 00:00:15,275
As you can see,

7
00:00:15,275 --> 00:00:17,780
it looks like a little profile page about me,

8
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,630
and it contains richer content.

9
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,310
So let's go back to JSBin,

10
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,366
and create this page from scratch.

11
00:00:25,366 --> 00:00:27,885
So here I am back in JSBin.

12
00:00:27,885 --> 00:00:30,485
I've opened up a new page.

13
00:00:30,485 --> 00:00:32,360
So let's start creating.

14
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,265
The first thing I'll do is change the title of our page,

15
00:00:37,265 --> 00:00:41,415
to something more meaningful.

16
00:00:41,415 --> 00:00:43,400
"Meet Andrew" for example.

17
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,890
If you recall on that page I showed you

18
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,455
we had my name in nice big letters.

19
00:00:48,455 --> 00:00:50,075
We can achieve this using the HTML

20
00:00:50,075 --> 00:00:53,030
heading elements in the body of my page.

21
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:57,400
The HTML5 defines six heading levels:

22
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,440
'h1' to 'h6', with 'h1' being

23
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,510
the most important heading and it is

24
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,530
rendered in a larger font than all others.

25
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,615
So I'll add my name using a h1 header.

26
00:01:08,615 --> 00:01:11,715
Here I type in this tag 'h1',

27
00:01:11,715 --> 00:01:14,925
and I have to close my tag,

28
00:01:14,925 --> 00:01:22,220
and in between, I'll just go ahead and write my name.

29
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,425
And as you can see on the right-hand side,

30
00:01:24,425 --> 00:01:27,770
my name displays in nice big letters.

31
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,260
Before moving on, let's try

32
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,290
to put the original page that I showed you,

33
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,850
my little profile page,

34
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,555
side by side with this JSBin page,

35
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,020
so we can see

36
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,375
exactly what I'm talking about as we move along.

37
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:45,324
So to do that I'll just take this page, and move it over,

38
00:01:45,324 --> 00:01:49,450
and just align it up to the side of my window,

39
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:54,000
and let me see I can make this one a lot smaller.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,550
Now the next thing to work

41
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,070
on is adding an image to our page.

42
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,900
We do this using the 'img' or image tag.

43
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,005
I'll just add one here.

44
00:02:05,005 --> 00:02:07,810
As you can see, this is

45
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:11,290
a self closing tag meaning you don't have an end tag.

46
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,855
Inside the image tag,

47
00:02:12,855 --> 00:02:15,490
we'll use some attributes to set up our image.

48
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:20,460
And the first one I'm going to use is the 'alt' attribute.

49
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,965
Now the alt attribute specifies

50
00:02:23,965 --> 00:02:25,600
alternate text for the image which is

51
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,955
very important in two scenarios.

52
00:02:27,955 --> 00:02:31,240
If for some reason the image you define can't be loaded,

53
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,440
the page will at least show this text.

54
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,730
It's also used by screen reading software to

55
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,450
help describe to those that are visually impaired,

56
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,195
what has been shown in the image.

57
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:44,037
So make sure the text is descriptive.

58
00:02:44,037 --> 00:02:49,920
In this case I'll just write "A picture of Andrew Byrne".

59
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:56,035
The next attribute to use is the 'src' or source attribute.

60
00:02:56,035 --> 00:02:59,220
And this attribute tells

61
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,755
the HTML page the location of the image,

62
00:03:01,755 --> 00:03:04,690
by specifying a URL.

63
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:09,560
So I'll just paste my location of my image into

64
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,885
this source attribute and there you go.

65
00:03:14,885 --> 00:03:17,820
So you see the image has appeared but it is very big.

66
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,340
So let's restrict the dimensions of

67
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,500
the image using another attribute.

68
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:27,065
This time we'll use the width attribute.

69
00:03:27,065 --> 00:03:31,520
Here, I'll just specify a with the image, and as you

70
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,620
can see that has restricted the width and

71
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,762
therefore because of the aspect ratio,

72
00:03:35,762 --> 00:03:38,960
also the height of the image to this particular size.

73
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,905
And there you have it, a picture displaying on our page.

74
00:03:42,905 --> 00:03:46,595
Okay, it's time to add some text to the page.

75
00:03:46,595 --> 00:03:48,890
Let me introduce the paragraph

76
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,645
and break tags for that purpose.

77
00:03:51,645 --> 00:03:54,890
So as its name suggests, the paragraph tag 'p',

78
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,065
delimits a paragraph on your page.

79
00:03:57,065 --> 00:04:01,250
Let's add a paragraph tag and type some text inside.

80
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,615
So here I have a paragraph 'p' tag,

81
00:04:05,615 --> 00:04:10,425
and I'm just inside it.

82
00:04:10,425 --> 00:04:13,160
Just copy and paste, for the sake of time,

83
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,020
some text. As you can see

84
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,750
the text wraps on the page,

85
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,370
but if I want to add an actual new line,

86
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,900
you think I might need to just

87
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,720
simply hit enter and start typing.

88
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,245
So let's try to add more texts.

89
00:04:29,245 --> 00:04:33,285
If I go into my HTML and I hit at the end of this line,

90
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:37,600
if I hit "ENTER" or "RETURN" and start typing,

91
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,790
what you can see is

92
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,990
that the new line wasn't recognized and

93
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,270
the output is still in

94
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,525
the same line as the previous text.

95
00:04:46,525 --> 00:04:48,880
It's just wrapped on this page because of the size of

96
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,560
this window but still on the same line as you can see.

97
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,230
So the solution to this problem is to use

98
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,710
another paragraph element nested inside this one,

99
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,870
or more simply, I can use

100
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,200
the break 'br' self closing tag as follows.

101
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,020
So just before this particular sentence,

102
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,790
if I just put in the break tag,

103
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,610
it will move that to a new line, and I

104
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,275
can have as many of those as I like

105
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:18,270
inside my paragraphs and inside my text.

106
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:22,695
So there's some text i have added to my profile page.

107
00:05:22,695 --> 00:05:25,650
We're making really good progress now.

108
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:29,475
So let's look at this subheading.

109
00:05:29,475 --> 00:05:31,500
If you recall, I mentioned that

110
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,920
HTML5 defines a number of default heading levels.

111
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,980
So this time, we're going to go ahead and

112
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,305
we'll use a 'h2' header as follows.

113
00:05:41,305 --> 00:05:44,926
So just here, I'll say h2,

114
00:05:44,926 --> 00:05:52,280
and inside it, I'll add my text.

115
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,660
Great.

116
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,695
Let's list my hobbies

117
00:05:57,695 --> 00:05:59,475
using an unordered list.

118
00:05:59,475 --> 00:06:01,678
I'll just go outside of this heading tag,

119
00:06:01,678 --> 00:06:05,105
and here I'll use the ul element.

120
00:06:05,105 --> 00:06:07,790
Using the 'ul' tag.

121
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,100
So that's an unordered list and

122
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,265
it should contain a list of

123
00:06:12,265 --> 00:06:16,290
items represented by the 'li' tag.

124
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,445
So first line, i will add is

125
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:29,462
swimming, and then i will add another one, learning,

126
00:06:29,462 --> 00:06:33,605
and last but not least in this list,

127
00:06:33,605 --> 00:06:39,425
i will add spending time with family and friends.

128
00:06:39,425 --> 00:06:43,300
And that's my list.

129
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,310
And as you can see, it's

130
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,400
a bulleted list of items at the moment.

131
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,900
If I want to make it an ordered list,

132
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:54,290
I just change this 'ul' tag to 'ol'.

133
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,700
And as you can see over in

134
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,774
the output, it's actually changed to an ordered list.

135
00:06:59,774 --> 00:07:02,605
Of course now that this is an ordered list,

136
00:07:02,605 --> 00:07:09,215
I think I'll go ahead and change my priorities.

137
00:07:09,215 --> 00:07:11,710
So there you go. Now we have the page

138
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,770
and it's got this list of my hobbies

139
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,480
ordered exactly as I

140
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,665
have them over here in the original page.

141
00:07:18,665 --> 00:07:21,215
Our page is looking really good now.

142
00:07:21,215 --> 00:07:23,155
So the last thing to do is to add

143
00:07:23,155 --> 00:07:26,860
that link at the end to my Twitter page.

144
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,950
Now you see lots of links like this in HTML pages,

145
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,605
and when you click on one such as this one,

146
00:07:32,605 --> 00:07:36,060
the browser takes you to that link's destination.

147
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,880
In this case, it's my Twitter page.

148
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,775
Okay, so let's go back to the HTML editing.

149
00:07:42,775 --> 00:07:45,370
Links, also called hyperlinks,

150
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,360
are added to a page using the 'a' tag.

151
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,955
I'll start a new paragraph first and add some text,

152
00:07:52,955 --> 00:07:58,350
and here I'll say something like:

153
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:05,755
"Come say hello on Twitter at".

154
00:08:05,755 --> 00:08:08,980
Okay, so in line with this text, I'm going to

155
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,855
add the 'a' tag as follows.

156
00:08:12,855 --> 00:08:15,520
To tell the browser where to navigate to once the link is

157
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,370
clicked, I'll define the 'href' attribute:

158
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:24,535
'href='. And I'll just add in the URL or

159
00:08:24,535 --> 00:08:28,240
the destination address of

160
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,150
the page to which I want to navigate.

161
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:34,835
In this case, my Twitter account.

162
00:08:34,835 --> 00:08:41,275
So that's the 'href', and then what I need to do,

163
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:44,470
is to add some link text and I do that

164
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,575
by adding my Twitter handle in this case

165
00:08:47,575 --> 00:08:55,258
between the opening and closing tags for the hyperlink.

166
00:08:55,258 --> 00:08:56,585
And there you go.

167
00:08:56,585 --> 00:08:58,540
You can see that the link has been created on

168
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,523
the page. So that's it.

169
00:09:00,523 --> 00:09:02,770
We have a page replicated, it

170
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,120
looks exactly like the one that

171
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,710
I showed you at the start.

172
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,390
We've introduced a lot of

173
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,255
different HTML elements and tags.

174
00:09:10,255 --> 00:09:13,000
So why don't you try this out yourselves!
