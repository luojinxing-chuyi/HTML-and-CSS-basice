Hi there! In this video,

1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,720
we're going to take a closer look at how we add

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,955
images to our HTML pages.

3
00:00:06,955 --> 00:00:09,040
We'll explore how to load an image,

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,680
and how to give it a good alternate text value,

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,570
and a good title value,

6
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,510
as well as how to adjust the size of the image on

7
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,580
a page using 'height' and 'width' attributes.

8
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:19,990
We've all heard the phrase that

9
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,250
a picture paints a thousand words.

10
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,430
Well, images are a very important part

11
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,320
of any Web page design.

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,840
They enhance the visual appeal of a page,

13
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,895
can create excitement or interest about our content,

14
00:00:31,895 --> 00:00:33,550
and can have an impact on

15
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,050
the message we are sending our readers.

16
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,305
Let's load our first image.

17
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:40,660
To define an image on a page,

18
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,655
we use the image element.

19
00:00:44,655 --> 00:00:46,656
Now this is a self closing tag,

20
00:00:46,656 --> 00:00:50,683
meaning that it doesn't require an end tag.

21
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:52,390
To define the image, we go inside

22
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,765
the image tag and we set some attributes.

23
00:00:55,765 --> 00:00:57,460
One of the key attributes

24
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,140
to set is the source attribute,

25
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,940
which tells the browser the location of

26
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,860
the image and before I set

27
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,120
this let's have a look at

28
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,205
the images on my local machine.

29
00:01:07,205 --> 00:01:08,590
As you can see my "images.html",

30
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,765
which is this page,

31
00:01:10,765 --> 00:01:12,770
is here on my local machine.

32
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,775
And at the same level on my desk,

33
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:17,470
I have this "images" folder which is

34
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,540
a good practice for gathering all the images I

35
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,550
want to use on my web page

36
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,800
or Web site into this single folder.

37
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,225
Inside this "images" folder,

38
00:01:25,225 --> 00:01:26,260
I have lots of images,

39
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:30,520
some of them are png and jpg files and as you can

40
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,380
imagine any modern browser can

41
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,905
support these image types and can show the images.

42
00:01:35,905 --> 00:01:37,240
So the image I want to use

43
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,510
is located in this "images" folder

44
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:42,270
and it's called "beach.png".

45
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,605
So that's the value I will set here in my HTML page.

46
00:01:46,605 --> 00:01:55,310
I'll set the location to be: "images/beach.png"

47
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,760
So that's a relative path,

48
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,360
it's telling the browser that they'll find this image,

49
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,169
in an "images" folder and it's called, beach.png.

50
00:02:05,169 --> 00:02:06,880
So when I "Save" my file,

51
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,150
there you go, I have loaded my first image.

52
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,968
Let's talk now about the 'alt' attribute

53
00:02:11,968 --> 00:02:14,605
and why we add alternate text.

54
00:02:14,605 --> 00:02:16,600
The 'alt' attribute is important because

55
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,160
it offers an alternate source of

56
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,140
information about this image

57
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,030
for those who cannot see the image.

58
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,410
This text is read aloud by

59
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,090
screen reader software for those

60
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,400
with impaired vision or disabilities.

61
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,810
And search engines can't see the image either,

62
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,073
so they rely on the alt text

63
00:02:31,073 --> 00:02:34,000
to understand what the image is about.

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,190
This text is also displayed to the user if,

65
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,005
for some reason, the browser can't display your image.

66
00:02:39,005 --> 00:02:41,560
So for all of these reasons make sure you supply a

67
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,070
good descriptive alt text for every image.

68
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,600
Now what text you supply depends

69
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,475
on the type of image you are displaying.

70
00:02:48,475 --> 00:02:51,449
If the image is just a background or a decorative image,

71
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:53,080
you might not want to describe it with

72
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,200
this text and instead let the screen reader skip over it.

73
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,510
But for functional images or images

74
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,630
containing or supporting information for your page,

75
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,190
you should always apply this alt text.

76
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,980
Now, while the image we have in front of us

77
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,075
here could be decorative,

78
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:09,880
what of is being shown on the page that is,

79
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,153
renting a beach house,

80
00:03:11,153 --> 00:03:13,425
and this is a view from the backyard.

81
00:03:13,425 --> 00:03:14,830
In that case, I would provide

82
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,795
a description that conveys the meaning of the image.

83
00:03:17,795 --> 00:03:23,703
I think this would be a good alternate attribute value.

84
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,070
So here what I've said is:

85
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,820
"Enjoy the magnificent view of the beach and

86
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,790
the sea from this oceanfront cottage."

87
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,936
So, let's show the alt text

88
00:03:33,936 --> 00:03:36,230
in action when the browser can't load my image.

89
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,570
To do that, I'm going to break the link on

90
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:39,870
the page by pointing to

91
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,695
a location or file that doesn't exist.

92
00:03:42,695 --> 00:03:47,560
So for example, if I have a typo here,

93
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,810
and that now is a file that doesn't exist on my disk,

94
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,488
so as you can see,

95
00:03:55,488 --> 00:03:57,810
when the link for the image

96
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,870
points to a file that doesn't exist,

97
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,960
our alt text is displayed nice and clearly on the page.

98
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,785
So this is the view that you would see.

99
00:04:05,785 --> 00:04:07,440
It's not ideal but at least you still get

100
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,185
some information and can continue with the page.

101
00:04:10,185 --> 00:04:13,445
So that's the alt text attribute.

102
00:04:13,445 --> 00:04:15,000
So let's go ahead and

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,440
repair our link so we can see the image again.

104
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,610
I'll just change it back to

105
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,105
the original value, and

106
00:04:23,105 --> 00:04:26,905
I'll move this down so we can see it.

107
00:04:26,905 --> 00:04:30,820
So the next attribute that I'd like to talk

108
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,503
to you about is the 'title' attribute.

109
00:04:33,503 --> 00:04:35,260
Now this is a global attribute and it's

110
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,215
supported by the image element.

111
00:04:37,215 --> 00:04:39,595
It's used to convey more information about the image.

112
00:04:39,595 --> 00:04:42,070
So for example, if I type in,

113
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,410
'title=' and then paste in

114
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,362
some descriptive text it says,

115
00:04:47,362 --> 00:04:49,225
"Oceanfront view from

116
00:04:49,225 --> 00:04:52,250
the Surfers Paradise rental cottage, California."

117
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,030
And what happens is, if I sav my page,

118
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,395
nothing looks like it happened over on the page.

119
00:04:57,395 --> 00:04:59,925
But if I hover over the actual image,

120
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,390
now I get that information.

121
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,730
So this is a visual element that is displaying

122
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,648
more information about the actual image in question.

123
00:05:06,648 --> 00:05:08,680
So that's the 'title' attribute.

124
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,115
Now let's have a look at how you adjust

125
00:05:10,115 --> 00:05:12,370
the size of the image on our page.

126
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,875
For that I'm going to need a bigger image.

127
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,780
So to save time I'll just "Paste" in

128
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,050
a new image and "Save" my page.

129
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,632
And as you can see this is a new image,

130
00:05:22,632 --> 00:05:26,585
smiley.jpg and if I scroll down you can see whooo,

131
00:05:26,585 --> 00:05:28,460
this is a very large image.

132
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,881
So, what can we do?

133
00:05:29,881 --> 00:05:31,930
Well we can easily fix this with

134
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,825
the help of the 'width' and 'height' attributes.

135
00:05:34,825 --> 00:05:37,560
While I use this attribute 'width',

136
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,685
I'll have to define this in pixels.

137
00:05:39,685 --> 00:05:41,936
So you may have heard the term pixel before.

138
00:05:41,936 --> 00:05:44,690
It's just a unit of measurement for computer screens.

139
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,750
Each screen is made up of millions of

140
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,985
these tiny squares called pixels.

141
00:05:48,985 --> 00:05:50,950
For example, my monitor that you see

142
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,905
here is 1920 by 1080,

143
00:05:53,905 --> 00:05:56,890
meaning it's a thousand nine hundred and twenty

144
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:01,330
pixels tall and a thousand eighty pixels wide.

145
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,650
So let's try 'width' value in

146
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,810
pixels and I'll pick something small.

147
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,895
Say, 300, and I'll "Save" my image.

148
00:06:07,895 --> 00:06:09,850
And after I just scroll down you can see

149
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,900
my image is actually showing.

150
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,385
So again if I remove the 'width', "Save" again,

151
00:06:16,385 --> 00:06:19,600
you can see the image is in its native size but

152
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,570
if I was to set the 'width',

153
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:28,065
you can see the image shrinks down to a nice size.

154
00:06:28,065 --> 00:06:31,035
You also notice that I've only defined a new 'width'

155
00:06:31,035 --> 00:06:33,500
attribute value but the height

156
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,055
of the image has also been adjusted.

157
00:06:35,055 --> 00:06:36,660
Well that's because the browser tries to

158
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,510
maintain the aspect ratio of the image.

159
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:45,807
So, I could define a 'height' attribute as well.

160
00:06:45,807 --> 00:06:47,715
And when I "Save" my image,

161
00:06:47,715 --> 00:06:51,570
when I scroll down you can see that the image height has

162
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,400
changed and the image looks

163
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,110
squashed because I've changed the aspect ratio,

164
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,585
the height to width ratio.

165
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:02,505
So I'll just remove that once more,

166
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,460
and there we have a smaller image.

167
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,400
So that's changing the size of an image using

168
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,380
the 'width' and 'height' attributes.

169
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,545
Finally, I'd like to show you how to load remote images.

170
00:07:16,545 --> 00:07:19,020
Up until this point we've loaded images

171
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,625
located on a path relative to our page.

172
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,845
As you can see here the smiley.jpg

173
00:07:23,845 --> 00:07:25,890
image is in a folder called

174
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:31,180
"images" relative to this page called images.html

175
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,330
However, the real power of the Web is to be able to

176
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,785
gather information from across the Internet.

177
00:07:35,785 --> 00:07:38,700
And all we need to do is supply an address.

178
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,960
This time, I'll "Paste" one in and as you can see,

179
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,940
this is just a URL and it's

180
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,210
telling the browser to find this image located at

181
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,950
this site and

182
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:57,165
gist.githubsercontent.com/AndrewJburn, etc., etc.

183
00:07:57,165 --> 00:07:59,850
At the end of this long URL is

184
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:04,615
just the name of my image, image001/png.

185
00:08:04,615 --> 00:08:08,275
And when I "Save" my file and we scroll down,

186
00:08:08,275 --> 00:08:11,160
you can see that that image has been loaded from

187
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,115
this remote site into our Web page.

188
00:08:15,115 --> 00:08:16,447
So, that's it.

189
00:08:16,447 --> 00:08:18,435
In this video, we'd fun with images,

190
00:08:18,435 --> 00:08:21,235
the image tag and its attributes.

191
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:22,730
So, you're all set to spice up

192
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,370
your pages with some images. Take care!
