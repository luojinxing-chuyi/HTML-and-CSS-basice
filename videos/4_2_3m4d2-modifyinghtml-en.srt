Welcome. In this demo,

1
00:00:02,945 --> 00:00:06,340
I'm going to show how you can use the developers tools in

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,690
your browser to modify your HTML elements, and

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,755
their attribute values, as well as your CSS properties

4
00:00:14,755 --> 00:00:19,870
and their values to make modifications to your Web page,

5
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:23,585
immediately see their effect on the page.

6
00:00:23,585 --> 00:00:26,110
And when you become happy with the values you have

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,820
experimented with, and you

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,470
have reached the results you want,

9
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,745
you can take those values to your code,

10
00:00:31,745 --> 00:00:33,310
save them and have the page

11
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:36,485
render the same way every time.

12
00:00:36,485 --> 00:00:39,010
So, if you recall from

13
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,020
the previous lesson that the way to

14
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,330
bring up the developers tools of your browser

15
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:48,475
is to either press F12 in your keyboard, or use

16
00:00:48,475 --> 00:00:51,175
the mouse to inspect any of

17
00:00:51,175 --> 00:00:54,820
the elements or the sections on your Web page.

18
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,160
So I'm going to go with that approach

19
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,650
here, and right click anywhere on my page,

20
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,080
and it shows "Inspect Element",

21
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,560
which is not bring up the developer's tools for me.

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,710
I'm using Microsoft Edge

23
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,070
as my browser today in this demo.

24
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,305
And as you can see,

25
00:01:14,305 --> 00:01:17,540
I did a right click on this list item here,

26
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,175
so it brought up the developers tools for me, and it was

27
00:01:21,175 --> 00:01:25,810
highlighted on this particular element

28
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,645
I choose to inspect.

29
00:01:27,645 --> 00:01:30,820
So, for this demo I'm thinking,

30
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,410
maybe I will change

31
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,410
this image here to show you how you can

32
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,540
modify your values in

33
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,440
your tags and see them right away on the Web page.

34
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,855
So I'm going to go to my image here,

35
00:01:43,855 --> 00:01:45,400
and I'm thinking to use

36
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,735
another image other than this one.

37
00:01:47,735 --> 00:01:49,720
So, to do a modification on the HTML tag,

38
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,720
you'll just go to the tag you would like to change,

39
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:59,114
double click on it so it brings you up in an edit mode.

40
00:01:59,114 --> 00:02:02,890
I know that I have another image in this tag,

41
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,968
it just has another filename,

42
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:09,610
so I'm going to move this filename here, and use

43
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,950
the other image I know I have it here.

44
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,520
So, I do my modifications and then press "Enter".

45
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,070
And I should see the changes right away on the Web page.

46
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:26,283
So I see this seagull bird here,

47
00:02:26,283 --> 00:02:28,795
but it doesn't really work

48
00:02:28,795 --> 00:02:31,438
well for that context of my page so

49
00:02:31,438 --> 00:02:37,885
I'm going to put it back to the right image here.

50
00:02:37,885 --> 00:02:42,150
And this is how you can modify your HTML elements.

51
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,060
One more thing you can modify in

52
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,250
the developer's tools is the tyles, the CSS styles.

53
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,145
And there is a pane

54
00:02:51,145 --> 00:02:52,210
for that here in

55
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,435
the developers tools, so on the right here,

56
00:02:54,435 --> 00:02:57,730
this is the pane for your CSS values.

57
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,070
So I'm here on this image tag.

58
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,895
It's highlighted, so that means it is selected,

59
00:03:03,895 --> 00:03:06,435
so I can change the width.

60
00:03:06,435 --> 00:03:07,670
So as you see here,

61
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,755
it's set to 400 pixels.

62
00:03:09,755 --> 00:03:14,185
I can change this value again by right clicking on it,

63
00:03:14,185 --> 00:03:18,315
and let's say I'm going to do 1000.

64
00:03:18,315 --> 00:03:22,210
See how changing the value changes

65
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,810
the width of the image on the page right away, and you get

66
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,760
to see your modifications right away.

67
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:34,115
So, this is a nice tool to try different values.

68
00:03:34,115 --> 00:03:36,370
If you're not happy with how your page is rendered,

69
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,990
you can try different values

70
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,595
here in the developer's tools.

71
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:43,240
And once you're settled and happy with the results,

72
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,835
you can copy those values to your code.

73
00:03:46,835 --> 00:03:49,307
So, I'm going to click this back to 400.

74
00:03:49,307 --> 00:03:54,705
There is also an option here to uncheck a style so that

75
00:03:54,705 --> 00:04:00,950
it deletes or it takes away from the effect,

76
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:05,480
so it's basically ineffective here.

77
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,675
I'm going to put it back.

78
00:04:06,675 --> 00:04:10,185
There is also a way to try new stuff,

79
00:04:10,185 --> 00:04:12,800
so let's try new styles.

80
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,305
So let's say, for example,

81
00:04:14,305 --> 00:04:16,450
I want to make a background.

82
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,220
I want to make a highlight on

83
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,435
this module because it's really important.

84
00:04:20,435 --> 00:04:29,010
So I'm gonna go to it and I'm going to select "Elements".

85
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,268
I'm going to select this element,

86
00:04:31,268 --> 00:04:33,285
brings me up to where it is in the code.

87
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:35,890
I'm gonna try a background style

88
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,700
on it and see how it looks like.

89
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,250
And you see in Microsoft Edge developers tools,

90
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,230
there is an IntelliSense here that really comes handy and

91
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,210
helpful so that you don't need to memorize

92
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,130
every single CSS property or style.

93
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,075
So I'm going to use a background of

94
00:04:51,075 --> 00:04:53,640
yellow, maybe light yellow is better.

95
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:58,845
So you see your styles,

96
00:04:58,845 --> 00:05:02,063
the styles get rendered on the page right away,

97
00:05:02,063 --> 00:05:05,555
and this is really cool.

98
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:09,740
And I think I also want to apply a font color here.

99
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:15,000
So, I'm going to change the color of this one to,

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,675
how about red, or orange red?

101
00:05:20,675 --> 00:05:23,295
So you see how it's like your values

102
00:05:23,295 --> 00:05:26,490
get rendered on the page right away.

103
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:31,015
Also, you can remove one of the properties,

104
00:05:31,015 --> 00:05:33,690
or keep them, or remove them both.

105
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,435
And as you see here on this pane here,

106
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:38,390
as you put a style into effect,

107
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,775
it gets added to the tag.

108
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:43,290
So this is another way to tell you,

109
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,395
if you want to keep this style,

110
00:05:46,395 --> 00:05:49,470
you should change your HTML code to add

111
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,910
this style attribute to your tag.

112
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,695
That's it for this demo,

113
00:05:54,695 --> 00:05:57,280
and I'll see you in the next one.
