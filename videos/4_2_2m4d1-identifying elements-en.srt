Hello and welcome to

1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:07,305
Module 4 of HTML5 and CSS Fundamentals Course.

2
00:00:07,305 --> 00:00:11,020
As you know, in this module we're going to cover

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:16,395
parts for debugging your HTML page,

4
00:00:16,395 --> 00:00:19,855
identify where HTML elements are in your code,

5
00:00:19,855 --> 00:00:21,815
how they are rendered on the page

6
00:00:21,815 --> 00:00:23,888
if you need to fix something.

7
00:00:23,888 --> 00:00:25,030
And to start with that,

8
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,570
we need to learn the tool that

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,131
you are going to use to do that.

10
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:34,080
Microsoft Edge, which is

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,250
the browser we're using in this demo,

12
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:42,000
we have developer tools which similarly come in most of

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,130
the browsers and modern browsers now.

14
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,110
And those developer tools are

15
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,980
usually evoked or initiated by

16
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,725
pressing F12 on your keyboard,

17
00:00:55,725 --> 00:00:58,990
or by going anywhere on your Web page,

18
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,610
right click, and choose

19
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,015
"Views Source", or "Inspect Element".

20
00:01:04,015 --> 00:01:06,120
Both of these options should bring up

21
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,360
the developer's tools in your browser.

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,955
So I'm going to say "Inspect Element",

23
00:01:11,955 --> 00:01:15,615
which brings up this part here in my browser,

24
00:01:15,615 --> 00:01:19,555
which is basically the developer's tools.

25
00:01:19,555 --> 00:01:22,370
And as you see here in Microsoft Edge,

26
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:26,180
it's divided into tabs for Console,

27
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,953
Debugger Network, Performance and others.

28
00:01:30,953 --> 00:01:33,060
For our course, we're only

29
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,575
concerned with this tab here, the DOM Explorer,

30
00:01:36,575 --> 00:01:38,605
and as you may know,

31
00:01:38,605 --> 00:01:41,550
DOM stands for the Document Object Model,

32
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,610
which is basically the building parts of

33
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,370
your Web page which

34
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:51,180
is basically your HTML elements and tags.

35
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,815
The view in this tab is divided into two parts.

36
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:57,810
The right part here is concerned with

37
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,975
the styles of your elements,

38
00:02:00,975 --> 00:02:03,380
which come from the CSS properties

39
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,060
and CSS values you're using on the page.

40
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,040
There is Styles here and there is

41
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,030
Computed Styles and Layout which we

42
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,580
are going to cover later in

43
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,435
this course and other modules and in this module as well.

44
00:02:18,435 --> 00:02:23,340
So now, for the DOM elements, as you may see,

45
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,810
there is a lot of parts that get

46
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,480
highlighted as I move my mouse over here,

47
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,520
which is how you're going to

48
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,785
identify your HTML parts of the page.

49
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:38,505
So, these are two buttons here in this tab.

50
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:42,280
So the first button here is to select element.

51
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:48,055
So when you press on this one and

52
00:02:48,055 --> 00:02:50,245
you go hover over our

53
00:02:50,245 --> 00:02:54,046
"Select Any Element" on your page and hover over it,

54
00:02:54,046 --> 00:02:56,700
you'll see that this is considered a part.

55
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,200
There is a tag for this.

56
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,790
There is a tag for this, and

57
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,935
there's a tag for this, and so on.

58
00:03:01,935 --> 00:03:04,515
So when you hover over them, they get highlighted.

59
00:03:04,515 --> 00:03:07,817
But if you want to see where it is in your HTML code,

60
00:03:07,817 --> 00:03:09,210
you get to click on it.

61
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,420
So I want to investigate or see

62
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,240
the HTML code that's responsible for

63
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,350
this bullet point or list item here.

64
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,010
So I'm going to click on it, so it

65
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,095
brings me here to where that is.

66
00:03:22,095 --> 00:03:27,010
I see it's an anchor tag that's inside the list item.

67
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,420
And this is a list item in an unordered list.

68
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,400
So, as you may see here,

69
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,830
as I move my mouse in the code also,

70
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,450
the parts and the page get highlighted.

71
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,190
So this is the other way round like if

72
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,705
you're looking at code

73
00:03:44,705 --> 00:03:47,670
and you don't know where that is in the page,

74
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,860
so you're just move your mouse

75
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,650
or hover over those elements in the code, and

76
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,230
they get highlighted on the page, and then you

77
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,410
get to see where they are or how they are rendered.

78
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:05,070
So, these are the two useful explorers

79
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,285
or investigation points in

80
00:04:07,285 --> 00:04:10,975
your DOM Explorer that help you identify where

81
00:04:10,975 --> 00:04:13,530
your HTML elements are in

82
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,240
the code, and how they are rendered on the Web page.

83
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,785
That's it for this demo,

84
00:04:18,785 --> 00:04:22,820
and I will see you in the next one.
