Hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to give you

1
00:00:02,865 --> 00:00:06,165
a brief overview of a site called CodePen.

2
00:00:06,165 --> 00:00:10,560
I'm already at the site here in my browser at codepen.io,

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,340
so you should browse there, too.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,860
And here I am at the landing

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,165
page and I haven't logged in,

6
00:00:15,165 --> 00:00:16,910
I don't have an account.

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,890
What I'm going to show you now is just a very brief

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,765
overview of what the site can be used for.

9
00:00:22,765 --> 00:00:27,275
A "Pen" in this site is kind of like a Code snippet.

10
00:00:27,275 --> 00:00:28,850
It's code you can write,

11
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,050
or you can also explore Pens that

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,520
the community has put up on the site for you to consume.

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,840
Let's start there, let's have a look at

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,730
what a Pen might look like.

15
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,650
To do that, I'm going over here on

16
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,088
the top right to the "Search" button,

17
00:00:43,088 --> 00:00:45,990
and I get a nice big Search text box.

18
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,240
And if I just type in a term that I'm

19
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,505
interested in, for example, "Button",

20
00:00:50,505 --> 00:00:52,650
and I just wait a brief second,

21
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:58,345
you'll see that that search returns 936,000 Pens.

22
00:00:58,345 --> 00:01:01,110
So these are pieces of code that other people have

23
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,764
shared that contain something to do with Buttons,

24
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:06,098
the key word "Button".

25
00:01:06,098 --> 00:01:08,970
And so, this is the list that you'll get back and you can

26
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,030
explore and do a lot of configuration on the search.

27
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,105
To see the code behind one of these,

28
00:01:15,105 --> 00:01:18,225
you would click on the Tile that has been returned.

29
00:01:18,225 --> 00:01:19,426
And I'll do it,

30
00:01:19,426 --> 00:01:20,663
I'll click on this one.

31
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:23,100
And you can see an "Editor" opens up,

32
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,750
and it has a HTML Pane, A CSS Pane,

33
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,015
a JavaScript Pane,

34
00:01:27,015 --> 00:01:29,513
and an Output Pane. This is just an example.

35
00:01:29,513 --> 00:01:31,200
We won't go into the code in this example.

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,340
But you can see that this is a live preview of what's

37
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,570
being shown here from

38
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,685
the code out down here below in the Output window.

39
00:01:39,685 --> 00:01:43,395
So let's go back. That was just an example of a Pen

40
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:45,268
that someone else has created and

41
00:01:45,268 --> 00:01:47,830
they've decided to share it publicly.

42
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,145
Why don't we try and create our first Pen?

43
00:01:50,145 --> 00:01:51,990
To do that, we're going to come

44
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,485
over to the "Create" button here.

45
00:01:54,485 --> 00:01:56,220
Click on "New Pen". And you'll

46
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,765
notice I still haven't logged in.

47
00:01:57,765 --> 00:02:01,030
I'm just using the site as a public visitor.

48
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:05,295
So I click on "New Pen" and an empty editor opens up.

49
00:02:05,295 --> 00:02:09,600
You can see the three panes HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

50
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,570
Nice big output panel here down in the bottom.

51
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,150
Don't like this view?

52
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,610
Go ahead and "Change view",

53
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,840
and you can reconfigure it to have editors on the left,

54
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,825
the editors on the right, et cetera.

55
00:02:20,825 --> 00:02:23,205
Now, I'll just stick to the "Default view".

56
00:02:23,205 --> 00:02:26,625
Also, only going to code some HTML, so here,

57
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:28,400
I'm going to "Maximize the

58
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,530
HTML editor" which slides the others

59
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,510
out of view of a nice lot of space here to work with.

60
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,450
To save some time, let's just paste in some HTML.

61
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,630
What you see here is that the preview is live, as in,

62
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,670
when I make a change in my code,

63
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,045
it shows up in the output practically instantaneously,

64
00:02:47,045 --> 00:02:48,770
which is a really great feature.

65
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,585
Let's change the code to watch it in action.

66
00:02:50,585 --> 00:02:53,365
So, I'm going to change my code "Hello CodePen!"

67
00:02:53,365 --> 00:02:56,435
I'm going to wrap it in a header, H1 header,

68
00:02:56,435 --> 00:02:58,145
and we should see that text

69
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:00,855
get larger in the output panel.

70
00:03:00,855 --> 00:03:05,186
So I put in my tag,

71
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:07,030
and you can see

72
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,700
that it's actually expanded which is great.

73
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,600
The other nifty little features that you can use here:

74
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,390
if you get HTML into a state you're not happy

75
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,813
with how it looks on the screen,

76
00:03:18,813 --> 00:03:20,915
you can say "Tidy HTML".

77
00:03:20,915 --> 00:03:23,275
And we'll try to indent a little bit better

78
00:03:23,275 --> 00:03:26,280
and spread it out so that it's more readable.

79
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,380
Even go as far as going into the

80
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,840
"Settings" and under "Behavior",

81
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,610
use "Tabs" over "Spaces".

82
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,740
So that's a nice feature.

83
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,200
So that's the code editing part of CodePen.

84
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,245
And I encourage you, if you don't want to download

85
00:03:40,245 --> 00:03:43,488
a tool or other editors,

86
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,020
you can browse here for free and write

87
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,320
some code and see it appear in the Output window.

88
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,814
Take other people's code and play with it.

89
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:55,260
Explore with their cool creations

90
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,230
and try that stuff out as well.

91
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,855
Another reason I wanted to introduce CodePen is,

92
00:04:00,855 --> 00:04:03,210
because if you look at our course,

93
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:07,095
you may come across this editor here in line,

94
00:04:07,095 --> 00:04:09,520
inside the content that we've created.

95
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,085
It's an embedded CodePen editor.

96
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,630
In this example, it shows you two panes,

97
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,800
the "HTML" code and the "Result".

98
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,480
Switch off the "Result"and just show

99
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,255
the "HTML" by clicking on the "Result" button.

100
00:04:21,255 --> 00:04:24,780
Vice versa. I can also edit inline here.

101
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,385
So for example, if I go into this paragraph

102
00:04:27,385 --> 00:04:30,600
in code and I say something like "Hi!",

103
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,420
that will refresh, on the right hand side,

104
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,500
the actual output, which is interesting.

105
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,025
I'll just ignore that DOCTYPE warning for the moment.

106
00:04:39,025 --> 00:04:41,680
That's not really important right now.

107
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,050
This is a live editing experience

108
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,580
embedded into our course,

109
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,583
but you can go over to CodePen which is where we've been,

110
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:53,125
and you can navigate to the actual Pen that was created.

111
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:56,625
And here, you can see that in the CodePen site.

112
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,300
And you get yourself an account on CodePen.

113
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,180
You're able to do stuff like just fork this,

114
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,750
which is effectively copying

115
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,700
this actual Pen into

116
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,635
your own account so you can play with it,

117
00:05:07,635 --> 00:05:10,140
use it, and so on, and so forth.

118
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,310
That's the round tripping. I just

119
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,495
wanted to make sure you see.

120
00:05:12,495 --> 00:05:16,110
When you come across these integers inside our course,

121
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,760
you'll know that that's really

122
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,646
a CodePen editor inside the content,

123
00:05:20,646 --> 00:05:23,415
that you can then go and use the CodePen site,

124
00:05:23,415 --> 00:05:27,600
or use it directly inside the content itself.

125
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,640
So that's it. A very quick look at

126
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,650
the popular online editor and

127
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,855
front-end code playground called CodePen.

128
00:05:34,855 --> 00:05:37,000
Until next time, happy coding.
