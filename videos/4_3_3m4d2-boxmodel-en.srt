00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:06,065
Okay, let's see the Box Model here in our Web page.

1
00:00:06,065 --> 00:00:09,530
So, I'm going to start the developers tools.

2
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,580
I'm going to "Inspect Element" here.

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,480
And for the Box Model,

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,515
this comes in the "Styles" pane

5
00:00:18,515 --> 00:00:22,815
and should be in the "Layout" tab in Microsoft Edge.

6
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:25,460
So now, we're looking at

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,150
the Box Model for the body elements.

8
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,420
So for the body of the HTML page,

9
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,555
we can see there is a little bit of margin here.

10
00:00:35,555 --> 00:00:37,570
There is no border and there

11
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,770
is no padding and the content of

12
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,413
the body is taking this amount of space.

13
00:00:44,413 --> 00:00:54,110
So, I'm going to move on and focus on our list here.

14
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,408
For the list here,

15
00:00:55,408 --> 00:00:57,854
you can see there is an offset,

16
00:00:57,854 --> 00:00:59,405
some margin as well,

17
00:00:59,405 --> 00:01:03,560
and there is some padding on the left and

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,149
there is the content of the list.

19
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:13,971
So I'm going to add a border for my list here.

20
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:15,565
My border is going to be...

21
00:01:15,565 --> 00:01:22,995
I'm thinking 4 pixels solid style and green color.

22
00:01:22,995 --> 00:01:27,690
So now, I see this around my list here.

23
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:32,190
So, if I go to check the Box Model for my list,

24
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,465
I see that now I have a border of

25
00:01:34,465 --> 00:01:37,598
4 pixels on all sides.

26
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,295
We can change that, actually.

27
00:01:39,295 --> 00:01:41,565
So let's make it a little bit thicker.

28
00:01:41,565 --> 00:01:44,450
So it's 10 pixels from the top.

29
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,715
I can do the same for all sides of the border.

30
00:01:47,715 --> 00:01:50,895
And you see that there is no padding.

31
00:01:50,895 --> 00:01:52,898
I can add a little bit of padding, too,

32
00:01:52,898 --> 00:01:56,000
and see what happens.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,030
Margin also, we can like increase the margin or decrease

34
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,790
the margin and see how that's going

35
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,833
to like effect things on my page.

36
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:09,490
So let's put it back.

37
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,500
And that's it for this demo.

38
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,520
See you next time.
